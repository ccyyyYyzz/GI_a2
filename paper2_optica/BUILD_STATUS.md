# BUILD STATUS — Paper 2 (Optica): *Engineering What an Optical Sensor Cannot See*

**Program:** ROUND63 · Certified-Blindness / Three-Ledger line.
**Binding spec:** `docs/ROUND63_GPT_ROUND45_RULING_RAW.md` **Part C** (architecture FROZEN).
**Gate:** `results/round63_next/TLSG/` → **TLSG_PASS** (all 7 bars) → §C architecture frozen.
**Repo HEAD at build:** `35d858e` (branch `main`).
**Working dir:** `paper2_optica/` — nothing here touches `paper_prl/` (paper 1 frozen) or sealed artifacts.

## Phase log

### Phase 1 — claim matrix + hero figure (THIS PHASE) — COMPLETE

| Deliverable | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| Claim–source matrix (every quoted number → committed artifact → hash) | **DONE** | `CLAIM_SOURCE_MATRIX.md` |
| Frozen-source extraction (verbatim committed blobs) | **DONE** | `figures/_frozen_sources/*.committed.json` (11 files) |
| Figure style module (Optica; reuse of paper-1 `prl_style.py`) | **DONE** | `figures/o2_style.py` |
| Fig 1 hero "What the sensor cannot see" (3 linked panels) | **DONE** | `figures/fig1_hero.{py,pdf,png}` |
| Fig 2 jet transmutation (spec + built) | **DONE** | `figures/fig2_jet_transmutation.{py,pdf,png}` |
| Fig 3 three routes + calibration transfer (spec + built) | **DONE** | `figures/fig3_routes_transfer.{py,pdf,png}` |
| Build status + Optica limits | **DONE** | this file |

**Discipline held:** all figures read ONLY committed frozen JSONs extracted verbatim to
`figures/_frozen_sources/` (same protocol as paper 1). **No data generation.** All cited
artifact directories verified clean in the working tree.

### Phase 2 — prose (COMPLETE)

| Deliverable | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| Main article (5 sections, 3 theorems + jet-transmutation corollary, proof sketches) | **DONE** | `main.tex` → `main.pdf` (**6 pp**) |
| Supplement (full proofs S1–S4, negatives S5, methods+provenance S6, TLSG gate table) | **DONE** | `supplement.tex` → `supplement.pdf` (**6 pp**) |

**Compile (pdflatex, TeX Live 2024):** main and supplement both compile clean —
**0 undefined references, 0 missing citations, 0 overfull hbox** (worst residual box
eliminated; only a few benign underfull vboxes remain from full-width float pages).
All three committed figures embed (`fig1_hero`, `fig2_jet_transmutation`,
`fig3_routes_transfer`). All 11 main-text references are cited (no dangling entries).

**Section map (R45 §C3, organized by theorem — no 17-test chronology):**
1. Symmetry walls — Statistical Noether Wall Thm + support wall 6.6e-16 (A1) / energy wall 2.18e-16 (A3) + two breakers (B1 NA-clip ε¹ 0.97–1.03; B2 window 5.3e-2) + wall periodic table (supp S1).
2. Blindness capacity — Thm β_d=σ_d (4.2/4.3), robust envelope (4.4); 80@1e-5 single-plane (C1), 35@1e-4 joint (C2), σ_d curve (C3), C4/C5, fresh-draw min 80 + coverage 1.000 (C6/C7).
3. Restoring the jet — Jet Transmutation corollary + flow eq; Route 1 slope 4.00 (D1), Route 2 86–99% (D3), Route 3 DPSS ≤2.4e-4 (D4); noncomposability (4.6) with **both** →24 instances kept distinct (D5 IT5 SVD→DPSS; D6 IT4b Tukey 93×).
4. What finite data can certify — Three-Ledger Thm 1:√p:p; exponents −0.004/0.444/1.010 (E1), CVs (E2–E4), KT6 boundary blind power 0.051 + z2⁴ (E5/E6), projected jet above channel line (E7).
5. Wave-optics transfer — leak law (F1), floor decomposition (F2), COMSOL 15.5% (F3), M^1.8 + matched-cell 768 (F4/F5), real-DMD leak (F6), PWM constraint (F7).

**GAP flags — all honored in prose/captions (see CLAIM_SOURCE_MATRIX.md):**
- **GAP-1**: field wall cited as committed **6.6×10⁻¹⁶** everywhere (not R45's loose 7e-16). Hero + §1 + supp table all read 6.6e-16.
- **GAP-2**: joint **35@1e-4** (IT4b spectrum) and fresh-draw single-plane **80** (TLSG bar 7) are labelled with distinct provenance in the hero caption, §2, and Fig-3 caption.
- **GAP-3**: the two "→24" instances are separated — §3/supp S2 name IT5 SVD→DPSS (D5) and IT4b Tukey rim-kill 93× (D6) as different operators/splits.
- **GAP-4** (length): Optica Research Article guideline is 6–8 pp. The scaffold typesets at **6 pp** in a dense 10 pt / 0.8 in two-column layout; under `opticajnl` the same body expands toward the upper end of 6–8 pp. No padding was added — the anti-hype PRL house voice is kept. Abstract is ~100 words (Optica target), not the mistaken ≤35.

**Honesty machinery (symmetric):** IT6 segmentation-flood and IT7 coincidence-veto
(24% scene power) appear in supplement **S5** with the same KILL-verdict prominence as
the positives, and S5 is referenced from the main-text Discussion.

**Class-file status:** `opticajnl.cls` is **NOT installed** in this TeX Live 2024
toolchain (`kpsewhich opticajnl.cls` → empty; `opticameeting` also absent). Per the
task fallback, both files are **clean two-column (main) / one-column (supplement)
`article`-class scaffolds** with Optica-matching typography (Times, full-width
title/abstract, numbered sections, spanning `figure*`, ~100-word abstract). A TODO
header in each `.tex` records that the **final submission is a mechanical class swap**
to `\documentclass[10pt,twocolumn]{opticajnl}` + `\journal{opticajnl}` with **no body
edits required**. Same pdflatex toolchain that built `paper_prl`.

**Discipline held:** zero new numbers; every numerical claim traces to a
CLAIM_SOURCE_MATRIX.md row. `paper_prl/`, `results/`, `docs/`, the figures, and the
matrix were **not modified**. Companion Letter cited as `[COMPANION]`; user-reserved
placeholders (`[AUTHORS]`, `[AFFILIATION]`, `[FUNDING/ACKNOWLEDGMENTS]`, `[URL]`) left
intact exactly as in paper 1.

### Phase 3 — fix wave (merged adjudication READ1+READ2) — COMPLETE

Implements `REVIEW_ADJUDICATION.md` (coordinator merge of `REVIEW_READ1_GENERAL.md` +
`REVIEW_READ2_HOSTILE.md`). One wave; no data generation beyond deterministic recomputations
from committed JSON (logged in `CLAIM_SOURCE_MATRIX.md` → **DERIVED STATISTICS**).

**R1 reframe (READ2 R1 + READ1 F2/F3):** abstract + intro restructured to the three-part
contribution (physics mapping / measured certification apparatus / engineering doctrine); theorem
statements unchanged but each now carries a classical-attribution sentence (Thm 1 → van der Vaart
invariance⇒singular-Fisher; Thm 2 → Courant–Fischer/Weyl + Backus–Gilbert/TSVD; Thm 3 →
Ingster–Suslina detection boundary + Cramér–Rao); new **Relation to prior work** paragraph
(Backus–Gilbert, Barrett–Myers, Ingster, Wyner physical-layer security, Candès–Tao CS
certifiability — also neutralizes READ2 M5). 6 bibliography entries added (HornJohnson, BackusGilbert,
IngsterSuslina, BarrettMyers, Wyner, CandesTao — all real, canonical).

**R2 COMSOL two-sided (integrity):** §5 main + §S6 now report BOTH contrast agreement 15.5% AND
grain-size disagreement 65% (thin-screen 3.88 µm vs FEM 1.35 µm, 2.9× overestimate); "anchors/
validated" → scoped ("contrast statistics transfer; grain-scale do not"); per-realization spread
(11.6–60.9%, n=8) to supplement. Matrix F3 note added; append-only left the legacy row intact.

**M2:** §5 leak law compressed to one sentence + `[COMPANION]` (End Matter C) ownership; display
Eq.(7) removed (was verbatim duplicate). **M3:** TLSG prose now states n=4 p-points, single seed,
per-fit R² (0.003/0.983/0.9995) — AND the landed post-gate 10-seed bootstrap CIs wired in
(`TLSG_BOOTSTRAP.json` @`3646754`): matched/estimation CIs bracket target; **blind CI [0.446,0.465]
excludes ½ — stated plainly as a systematic ≈9% finite-p deviation**; gate verdict stands
(all 10 seeds pass, inside ±0.15). **M4/M1:** projected slope 4.0 reworded as a consistency check;
Fig 2 caption discloses analytic reconstruction; Gaussian-covariance scope moved into the Thm 3
statement + setup.

**READ1 MAJORs:** Figs 2 & 3 now cited in body (`\ref{fig:jet}` §4 Route 1; `\ref{fig:transfer}`
§2 + §5); abstract gains headline numbers (10⁻¹⁶ walls, 80-dim; COMSOL kept out of abstract);
"quotient jet" defined standalone at first use (intro); `g` de-collided → geometry scalar renamed
`γ` (identified with `z₂`), group element keeps `g`. **MINORs/NITs:** Fig 1 energy-wall label
2.2e-16 → **2.18×10⁻¹⁶** (regenerated from frozen sources; support wall stays 6.6e-16); two roles of
"80" disambiguated; four conjugate-floor values reconciled as one ~7×10⁻³ instrument floor; A/B
Chernoff coefficients → `c₁,c₂`; Fig 2 slope callout relocated (F9); Fig 3 panel `wspace` widened so
the y-label clears its ticks (F10); "seventeen-test" → "full verification battery" (F11); intro
preview now lists all five sections (F12); m1 "per-variant maximum" field leak; m2 coverage "(24/24
fresh draws)"; m4 COMSOL-license dependency noted in Data availability + S6.

**Compile (pdflatex, TeX Live 2024, 2× each):** `main.pdf` **7 pp**, `supplement.pdf` **6 pp** —
**0 undefined references, 0 missing citations, 0 overfull hbox** in both. Main within the ≤8 pp
budget. All 3 figures regenerated and re-embed. Placeholders untouched.

**Files edited this phase:** `main.tex`, `supplement.tex`, `CLAIM_SOURCE_MATRIX.md` (append-only:
DERIVED STATISTICS), `BUILD_STATUS.md`, `figures/fig1_hero.py` (+regenerated pdf/png),
`figures/fig2_jet_transmutation.py` (+pdf/png), `figures/fig3_routes_transfer.py` (+pdf/png).
NOT touched: `paper_prl/`, `results/`, `docs/`, `figures/_frozen_sources/`, the two review reports,
the adjudication.

## Section architecture (R45 §C3) — frozen

1. **Symmetry walls of an optical measurement** — Statistical Noether Wall theorem + two exact walls (§1 / matrix A,B).
2. **Measuring blindness capacity** — Blindness Capacity theorem, dimension–leak frontier, robustness (§2 / matrix C).
3. **Restoring the desired jet** — optical / code-space / statistical routes + noncomposability (§3 / matrix D).
4. **What finite data can certify** — Three-Ledger theorem + KT6 boundary (§4 / matrix E).
5. **Wave-optics transfer and apparatus constraints** — leak law, DPSS/SVD choice, single bucket, PWM (§5 / matrix F).

**No chronology of the 17 tests appears in the article** (R45 §C3). Supplement carries IT6/IT7
negatives, DPSS-vs-SVD noncomposability spectra, étendue and coherence-rank future objects (§C2).

### Frozen theorem set (R45 §C2)
1. Statistical Noether Wall Theorem · 2. Blindness Capacity Theorem (`β_d=σ_d`; `+δ` robustness) ·
3. Three-Ledger Certifiability Theorem (`1:√p:p`) · corollary 4. Jet Transmutation.

### Hero figure self-critique (R45 §C3)
The hero delivers the story in ~10 s to a non-specialist optics reader: a left-to-right causal
spine (**symmetry → capacity → certifiability**) over three quantitative panels — two machine-zero
walls with their breakers; a measured dimension–leak capacity curve (80 dims ≤1e-5, does not
compose); and the `1:√p:p` ladder with KT6 below the blind line and the projected jet above its
channel line. One-line takeaways sit under the two data panels. Verdict: **PASS** (see final report).

## Budgets & FORMAT LIMITS (Optica — verified against author resources, 2026-07)

**Venue:** Optica (flagship). Fallback: Physical Review Applied (R45 §C4).

| Item | Optica limit | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Abstract** | **~100 words** (explicit summary: problem, methods, major results/conclusions) | Optica Publishing Group Journal Style Guide |
| **Research Article length** | **6–8 published pages** | Optica submission guidelines |
| Letter (Optica Express-style short form) | 4 pages | Optica submission guidelines |
| Mini-review | 8–12 pages | Optica submission guidelines |
| Length metric | published pages (figures/tables count toward the page total); LaTeX via `opticameeting`/`opticajnl` class on Overleaf | Optica author portal |
| Figures | vector PDF/EPS or ≥300–600 dpi raster; colorblind-safe encouraged | Optica style guide |

**Corrected assumption:** the task asked whether Optica's abstract limit is ≤35 words — it is **not**;
the Optica abstract target is **~100 words**. The ~10–12 pp main-text target in the task **exceeds** the
Optica **Research Article** guideline of **6–8 pp** (10–12 pp is mini-review length). This is a
**Research Article** (original results), so the recommendation is to target **~8 pp main** with the
supplement carrying the negatives and extra spectra; a 10–12 pp submission is possible but invites an
over-length flag. Logged as **GAP-4** in the matrix (length-budget decision for Phase 2, not an
evidence gap).
